Disapproval of Elon Musk is top reason Tesla owners are selling, survey says - Electrek;https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9kaXNhcHByb3ZhbC1lbG9uLW11c2stdG9wLXJlYXNvbi10ZXNsYS1vd25lcnMtc2VsbGluZy1zdXJ2ZXkv0gEA?oc=5;2023-07-27 21:51:00;1;True;https://electrek.co/2023/07/27/disapproval-elon-musk-top-reason-tesla-owners-selling-survey/;;"The disapproval of Elon Musk is the top reason Tesla Model 3 owners are selling their electric vehicles and going for another brand, according to a new survey of 5,000 Model 3 owners. Since Musk acquired Twitter, the Tesla CEO has started to voice his political and social views more frequently, as well as share controversial conspiracy theories. This has resulted in a wave of people changing their minds about Musk, especially people on the left side of the American political spectrum. Many have suggested this has a negative impact on Tesla, which is intricately linked to Musk. Musk has dismissed this concern – claiming to be more popular than ever based on his Twitter follower count (yes, that’s an actual argument he used). To his defense, there has only been a limited amount of data supporting the view that his behavior is negatively affected Tesla… until now. Bloomberg has released the result of a thorough survey of 5,000 Tesla Model 3 customers, and a lot of it focused on Musk. With the sample size, it might be the best look into the minds of Model 3 owners we have seen to date. Amongst the Model 3 owners who sold or replaced their cars for a vehicle from another brand, the publication asked them what is the top reason, and “disapproval of Elon Musk” was the top answer: That’s somewhat surprising, but it’s important to put that answer into perspective. The survey also found that 87% of Model 3 owners are considering a Tesla for their next vehicles. That means it’s a fairly small percentage of people who are actually walking away from Tesla overall, and only about one in five of those people are doing it because of Musk. The rest of the survey is quite glowing for the Model 3, as most owners appear to be very happy about their purchase and how their cars are holding up. Electrek’s Take I knew it had an impact, but I’m honestly surprised it’s the top reason someone would replace their Model 3 for something from another brand. I thought quality or service would be first, but it’s a close second. Top comment by Haggy Liked by 55 people I'd take ""unhappy with brand perception"" and the part about Musk and roll them together, because he's the one who caused the unhappiness to a large part. It's not his political views per se that I have a problem with but that he openly antagonizes the left, many of whom are potential customers. He even went so far as to call them a hate group. (not everybody on the left, but Democrats, which is quite a large group). It's no secret that companies don't cut prices when customers are willing to pay existing prices. The drop in margins is due to Musk's behavior. Personally, I don't believe in cutting off my nose to spite Elon, and I think that people should get the car that they like best. He owns 12% of the company and it's other individual investors who actually need the money. I doubt there's any company that doesn't have at least 12% of investors that I'd disagree with. My next car won't be a Tesla, which is not entirely on Elon. I'm not buying something else because I don't like Tesla. There's competition out there, and turning off customers is a very bad way to run a business. View all comments If anything, it shows just how happy Tesla owners are with their vehicles, and therefore, Musk was able to quickly climb up the top of the list. Musk becoming more political is clearly having a negative impact, but it’s overall minimal when compared to the 87% of Model 3 owners still looking at a Tesla for their next vehicle. In percentage points, it is pretty small. Only 2.7% of Tesla buyers walk away because of Musk, according to this survey. But in Tesla’s world, that’s still 50,000 vehicles per year or a few billion dollars. Honestly, as long as those people are going with an EV from another brand, I don’t care much. But Tesla shareholders might think differently. What do you think? Let us know in the comment section below. Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Even Elon Musk — who has aligned himself with Republicans in Congress — thinks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell abruptly freezing mid-sentence during a weekly Republican leadership press conference was ""insane."" The billionaire Twitter boss suggested in a tweet early Thursday that there needs to be a constitutional amendment to implement term limits for members of the United States Congress. ""We need a constitutional amendment. This is insane,"" Musk said in a reply to a tweet of a video showing McConnell suddenly stop speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. —Elon Musk  (@elonmusk) July 27, 2023 At the beginning of Senate Republicans' weekly press conference on Wednesday, McConnell froze up mid-sentence before being escorted away by other senators and an aide. The 81-year-old Senate Minority leader from Kentucky later returned to the podium where he took questions from reporters and was forced to address the incident. ""I'm fine,"" McConnell replied after being asked whether his freezing up had anything to do with a concussion he had earlier this year after falling. A McConnell aide said that the GOP senator stepped away because he ""felt light-headed,"" and insisted that he was ""sharp"" when he returned to take questions. In the past, Musk has floated the idea of age limits for political leaders , saying in 2021 that anyone over 70 years old should be barred from holding office. Broadly speaking, Americans also think their government is too old. An Insider/Morning Consult poll conducted last year found that 77% of Americans would support an age cap on lawmakers serving in Congress. The survey was conducted as part of Insider's expansive ""Red, White, Gray "" series of reports that explored how the US has effectively become a ""gerontocracy."" Public support for passing an age cap is not likely to be enough. Experts say it would likely take a constitutional amendment to impose such a change. Lawmakers themselves, including younger ones, were also hesitant to support such a requirement. Many of them previously told Insider that would rather see term limits. Others said that the best bar remains the fact that lawmakers must continue to be reelected, even if incumbency comes with huge advantages. Musk has also been supportive of Republicans. Insider previously reported that the SpaceX and Twitter owner gave more in political donations to the GOP than to Democrats and earlier this year, Musk hosted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Twitter where he launched his campaign in a glitch-filled Twitter Spaces event .";"Elon Musk called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ""insane"" The billionaire Twitter boss suggested that there needs to be a constitutional amendment for term limits.

Musk, who owns Twitter and other companies, tweeted early Thursday morning, ""We need a constitutional amendment. This is insane.""

Fired Twitter exec who went viral for sleeping on the floor lifts the lid on Elon Musk’s unpredictable mood swings and ‘fanatical inner circle’ - Fortune;https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9lbG9uLW11c2stdHdpdHRlci14LW1vb2Qtc3dpbmdzLWlubmVyLWNpcmNsZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWJhZC1ib3NzLXNwYWNleC10ZXNsYS1lc3RoZXItY3Jhd2ZvcmQv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNy9lbG9uLW11c2stdHdpdHRlci14LW1vb2Qtc3dpbmdzLWlubmVyLWNpcmNsZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWJhZC1ib3NzLXNwYWNleC10ZXNsYS1lc3RoZXItY3Jhd2ZvcmQvYW1wLw?oc=5;2023-07-27 11:12:00;1;True;https://fortune.com/2023/07/27/elon-musk-twitter-x-mood-swings-inner-circle-management-bad-boss-spacex-tesla-esther-crawford/;;Elon Musk’s turbulent takeover of Twitter saw him establish a sycophantic inner circle of loyalists who were too afraid to tell him the truth, a former director at the firm has claimed. In a video posted to the platform on Wednesday, the company’s ex-director of product management Esther Crawford—who went viral last year after posting a photo of herself sleeping on the floor at Twitter HQ in a sleeping bag—shared her opinions on X and its future under Elon Musk. Crawford, who sold her social app Squad to Twitter in 2020 , went on to work for Twitter for two and a half years before being laid off. She described the pre-Musk Twitter as “siloed and bureaucratic,” and a place where “dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone’s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly.” “You couldn’t just be a builder—you also needed to be a politician,” she said. “There was little will to think beyond quarterly earnings calls.” Twitter 2.0’s ‘brutalist and hard-core culture’ In the lead-up to Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter , Crawford said she knew little about him but was optimistic about what he might do with the firm. “I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX , so [I thought] perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company,” she said. However, the reality of working under his stewardship came with multiple challenges, according to Crawford—including Musk’s unpredictability and the workload feeling “like playing life at Level 10 on Hard Mode.” “I made peace with the fact that I didn’t have psychological safety at Twitter 2.0 and that meant I could be fired at any moment, and for no reason at all,” she said. “I watched it happen repeatedly and saw how negatively it impacted team morale. I did my best to shine a light on folks who were doing important work while being an emotionally supportive leader for those who were struggling to adapt to the more brutalist and hard-core culture.” Crawford described Musk as “oddly charming” but said as a leader he was both inspirational and lacking in empathy to a “painful” degree. “The challenge is his personality and demeanor can turn on a dime going from excited to angry,” she said. “Since it was hard to read what mood he might be in and what his reaction would be to any given thing, people quickly became afraid of being called into meetings or having to share negative news with him.” ‘Fanatical’ inner circle afraid to tell Musk the truth As a people manager, Musk has often made headlines for his divisive tactics. Following the Twitter acquisition in October, the company reportedly suffered a wave of resignations after he demanded employees sign an oath to work “long hours at high intensity.” It came shortly after the social media firm began layoffs that would cut around half of its workforce. Musk’s reputation for questionable management practices stretches far beyond his tenure at the helm of Twitter, however, with employees at his other companies Tesla and SpaceX going public in the past with grievances about the way they were treated at work. According to Crawford, Twitter employees soon learned to cherry-pick the information they relayed to Musk after he took over as the company’s CEO (a position he relinquished to former NBCUniversal advertising exec Linda Yaccarino last month). “At times it felt like the inner circle was too zealous and fanatical in their unwavering support of everything he said,” Crawford alleged on Wednesday. “When individuals encouraged me to be careful about what I said I politely thanked them and said I would not be taking their advice. I had no interest in adding to a culture of fear or walking on eggshells around Elon. Either he would respect me for being real or he could fire me. Either outcome was okay.” Gut instinct However, it didn’t appear to matter whether Twitter employees were honest with Musk, Crawford suggested, as most of the decisions made at the company were based on him following his gut instinct. She noted that he did not seem interested in seeking out data or expertise to inform his business choices and was “obviously not afraid of blowing things up.” “That was particularly frustrating for me since I believed I had useful institutional knowledge that could help him make better decisions,” she said. “Instead he’d poll Twitter, ask a friend, or even ask his biographer for product advice. At times it seemed he trusted random feedback more than the people in the room who spent their lives dedicated to tackling the problem at hand. I never figured out why and remain puzzled by it.” Twitter began its rebrand to “X” over the weekend, as part of Musk’s ambition to create an “everything app.” A spokesperson for X did not respond to Fortune ’s request for comment on Crawford’s testimony. When it came to the future of X, Crawford suggested, the platform could either thrive or die. While Musk was gifted with an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems, Crawford said, he lacked the social-emotional intelligence to make the product soar. “Social networks are hard to kill, but they’re not immune from death spirals,” she said. “Only time will tell what the outcome will be, but I hope X finds its footing because competition is good for consumers.” “I disagree with many of [Musk’s] decisions and am surprised by his willingness to burn so much down, but with enough money and time, something new and innovative may emerge,” she added. “I hope it does.” Subscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.
